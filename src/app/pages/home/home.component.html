<h3><u>Mission</u></h3><br>
<p>
    The organization was established in the year 2022 to provide the training to all the computer teachers of the schools,
    so that quality education can be imparted to all the students.
</p> <br/>
<p>
    We wish to move the focus of teachings from learning computer basics to computer programming,
    where students can develop programming and logical skills. The shift is small but the impact is large.
    Today logic and programming is required from cooking in kitchen to running the air craft or satellite in the space.
    The same logic and programming is used in replacing a heart from the live human body.
</p><br/>
<p> Whether we are rich or poor, black or white, male or female, adult or kids; we all are gifted with a brain, which if train properly can 
    do miracles. It can solve difficult problems, it creates innovative solutions.It can do whole lot of things that was thought to be impossible in past.
    It can change the future, it can improve the standard of living, bring relief from pain. In simple words, it can change the world.
</p><br/>
<p> We wish to train that tender minds, with simple games, that excites the thinking ability, problem solving skills and establish a simple and 
    important point that programming is easy, programming can be learned. Once we achieve that level than all the applications start making sense,
    all the data start telling stories. We can start providing brains to machines who can perform some important tasks for us. 
    We can start making our life good and our earth a better place.
</p><br/>
<p> 
    Today computers are becoming smart and learning the human way of thinking which we called Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
    We are helping humans to become more smarter by teaching these technologies.
</p>
   
<br /><br /><br />

<h3><u>Vision</u></h3><br>

<h3><u>Plan</u></h3><br>
<p>
    Our plan to take the students from simple to more complex path with fun filled activities.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>For students in primary schools can develop programming skill using android games such as LightBots</li>
    <li>For students in 5th to 7th standard we wish to introduce visual programming</li>
    <li>For students in 8th and 9th standard we wish to introduce python programming</li>
    <li>For students in 11th and 12th standard we wish to introduce data analytics using python</li>
</ul>
